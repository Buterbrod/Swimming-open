# General
Lenex is an XML based data exchange format for swimming. The version 1.0 is used since 1999 in different countries of Europe. With the start of the European Rankings in 2004, a general revision of the format was done: Missing features, like records were added and unclear named tags were renamed to proper English. The result was version 2.0 of the Lenex format.

End of 2008 with some more experience using the Lenex format a new major release, Lenex 3.0 was published. There are some real changes, for example how result lists are represented, however the format is very similar to verson 2.0 and files are almost 100% backward compatible.The complete documentation in English is available as PDF document. In addition we offer some sample files.
